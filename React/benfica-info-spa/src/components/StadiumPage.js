            <p className="facts" style={{marginBottom: "50px"}}>Benfica's home is the Estadio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica, better known as the Estadio da Luz -- Stadium of Light in English -- although Luz actually refers to the neighbourhood of the same name. The stadium was rebuilt in time for Euro 2004, with Benfica moving in the year before and fans continuing to refer to the new 65,647-seater ground as the Cathedral -- the nickname for its previous incarnation. After the move, a new custom also took hold, whereby an eagle -- the club's mascot -- flies around the stadium before home games. Legend has it that Benfica will win when Vitoria or Gloriosa -- the names of the two resident eagles -- do more than two laps of the ground. If they land before then, the away team will win.</p>
